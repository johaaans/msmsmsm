      South America has a complex diversity from the aftermath of the many waves of colonialism and immigration that evolved into a wide variety of language variations. While many Latin American countries adopted Spanish as their principal language, they differ in pronunciation and vocabulary, sometimes varying by city. This diversity can either build pride or shame in each community since their language is an important part of their culture, and we still live in a racist society. In short, Latin America's history of immigration and emigration twisted and reconstructed the Spanish language into a multiverse.
