      As generations continue to move and mix into other cultures, we become more connected and inclusive. Nevertheless, there are side effects that are rooted in toxic nationalism, racism, and more so, colonialism. For instance, many Chicanos were not taught Spanish because of public–and even academic–oppression. Furthermore, many other immigrants unconsciously change or forget their vernacular languages because they try to fit into their new culture (Liao 4). This phenomenon is nothing new, and in the same way it happens now, it happened centuries ago.
